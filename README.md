# Multivariate Analysis of Louisiana and Mississippi Parishes

## 1.	Objective of Analysis.

  The purpose of this multivariate analysis is to study the relationship among different attributes that provide information about parishes in two states, Louisiana and Mississippi. It will be analyzed whether there is a significant difference between these two states in terms of their life expectancy and median household income. Furthermore, among various predictors the most important ones will be determined to obtain prediction values of life expectancy and median household income. In addition, it will be analyzed whether there are patterns and relationships between several variables simultaneously.
